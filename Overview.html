            <h2 id="chapter1">Chapter 1: Overview</h2>
            <p>
                With the release of Monster Hunter world and me finding a Monster Manual for Monster Hunter, <br>
                I wanted to create a Monster Hunter inspired Campaign.
            </p>
            <p>
                This Document will contain an overview of the world and how you would build a character inside this world.
            </p>
            <p>
                The <b>only</b> Rule is thats this is my homebrew world, 
                so it will differ significantly from the established world of Monster Hunter,
                if you at any point say: <q><i>This isn't how this works in Monster Hunter</i></q>, <br>
                you are subject to the possibility of me taking away a level.
            </p>

            <h3>The Corruption</h3>
            <p>
                Magic came in a flash and brought many new wonders with it. <br>
                Empires grew from and wars used this new power, but just as sudden as it began it disappeared. <br>
                In the absence of magic monsters poured out of the earth, feeding on everything and everyone magical. <br>
                Desperately defending, all of <strong>[Placeholdername]</strong> was forced into Strongholds, the last few bastions of survival. <br>
                With magic gone, few have retained the ability to cast spells <i>(cantrips)</i>
                and every now and then sparks of the arcane lend their light to those in need <i>(spell slots)</i>, <br>
                others use monster parts to augment themselves <i>(Sorcerers)</i> or their machinery <i>(Artificer or Bloodhunter)</i>. <br>
                Slowly this new confined life took the norm, with only a brave few obtaining the permission to venture out, <br>
                <b>the monster hunters</b>.
