                <p>
                    With the release of Monster Hunter world and me finding a Monster Manual for Monster Hunter, <br>
                    I wanted to create a Monster Hunter inspired Campaign.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The <b>only</b> Rule is thats this is my homebrew world, 
                    so it will differ significantly from the established world of Monster Hunter,
                    if you at any point say: <q><i>This isn't how this works in Monster Hunter</i></q>, <br>
                    you are subject to the possibility of me taking away a level.
                </p>
                <p>
                    In this Document I will explainthe world and how you build a character inside this world. <br>
                    As well as give some Ideas of the life of the people living in the world, through anecdotes inside the 
                    grey boxes.

                <h3>Creation Myth</h3>
                <p>
                    In ages past, long before we wrote down history, ancient beings existed and floated through the Astral Plane. <br>
                    Two of these Titans fought for dominance, but with their nearly equal strength they both perished in their long fought battle.
                    Their corpses became the very ground we walk on.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Best scholars can tell, <strong>[Placeholdername]</strong> came into existance when 2 Planets collided. <br>
                    The study of the planes has also found some validity to the claim of the story, but its generally believed amongst scholars that <strong>[Placeholdername]</strong>
                    came about due to the colision. <br>
                    The overlap of planes and their effets on the material plane are closely monitored, since it is theoriesed that the wrong overlap could have disastrous consequenses
                    on the material plane. <br>
                    On such overlap happened in the last century.
                </p>
                <h3>The Corruption</h3>
                <p>
                    Magic came in a flash and brought many new wonders with it. <br>
                    Empires grew from and wars used this new power, but just as sudden as it began it disappeared. <br>
                    In the absence of magic monsters poured out of the earth, feeding on everything and everyone magical. <br>
                    Desperately defending, all of <strong>[Placeholdername]</strong> was forced into Strongholds, the last few bastions of survival. <br>
                    With magic gone, few have retained the ability to cast spells <i>(cantrips)</i>
                    and every now and then sparks of the arcane lend their light to those in need <i>(spell slots)</i>, <br>
                    others use monster parts to augment themselves <i>(Sorcerers)</i> or their machinery <i>(Artificer or Bloodhunter)</i>. <br>
                    Slowly this new confined life took the norm, with only a brave few obtaining the permission to venture out, <br>
